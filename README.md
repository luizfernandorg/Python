my first github about python, I have code a few times, but just now I resolved to share my personal project

This project use Sqlite3

I use the code to analyse the lotter, here in Brazil, called Mega Sena
The lottery use 60 numbers and the person that gets right 4, 5 or 6 numbers get the specific prize
